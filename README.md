# Sound-Control-Server
Control Volume of Windows programs from Android. This is the server application.

See bairdo/Sound-Control-Android-App for the client application.

Basic functionality works (changing volume).

Server updates client of volume changes made outside the program(e.g. windows Volume Mixer, Keyboard)

# TODO List (not in any real order)
// todo update server so when new programs are added to audio (thing) they are also registered with the app. (without having to restart the server)

// todo receive icons from server.



// todo timestamp the udp packet, and only update if newer than the last

// todo have master vol (speaker static at top/bottom of page). DONE?



// todo have list so i can use it without the top of my screen. -  this is sort of covered by horozontal mode

// todo tidy up.

// todo rearrange-able list.

// todo nicer login screen.

// todo 'favourites' or profiles (probably need to save based on name.)

// todo make server a windows service (or whatever, so runs on startup)

// todo logging (server and app)

// todo command line args/config file (ports, logging) (server)

// todo save last used port and ip - DONE (maybe multiple ip and ports)(app).

// todo add a homepage widget

// todo add tests for both server and app

// todo ipv6

// todo error checking. what happens on invalid input from user (treat it gracefully)

// todo change speaker volume so works linearly (and in right to left direction).

// todo ability to send multiple updates in the same packet. (from server in  particular) will reduce the wasted overhead by ,making the packet data bigger.

// todo linux (ubuntu) version
